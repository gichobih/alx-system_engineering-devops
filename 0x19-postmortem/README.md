## Issue Summary

Duration of the Outage:
Start Time: 2024-08-16 14:00 UTC
End Time: 2024-08-16 14:45 UTC
Total Duration: 45 minutes
Impact:
The companyâ€™s main web application, which serves as a platform for users to manage their personal finances, experienced a total outage. Users were unable to access the platform during this time, resulting in a complete halt of all financial transaction processing and account management activities. Approximately 90% of the user base was affected, with the remaining 10% being offline users who did not attempt to access the platform during the outage.
Root Cause:
A misconfiguration in the Nginx load balancer caused it to fail to distribute traffic properly. The issue stemmed from an erroneous update to the load balancer's configuration file, where a syntax error led to the failure of the load balancer to forward traffic to the backend servers.

## Timeline


14:00 UTC:
The issue was detected when an automatic alert was triggered by the monitoring system, indicating a sudden drop in traffic to the web servers.
14:02 UTC:
The on-call engineer received the alert and began investigating the issue. Initial assumption was a network connectivity problem.
14:05 UTC:
The engineer checked the network logs but found no issues. The investigation then shifted to the load balancer.
14:10 UTC:
The engineer noticed that the Nginx service was not responding correctly. Attempts to restart the service were unsuccessful, as the configuration file was causing the service to crash on startup.
14:15 UTC:
The issue was escalated to the DevOps team, who immediately began reviewing the recent configuration changes made to the load balancer.
14:25 UTC:
The DevOps team identified a syntax error in the Nginx configuration file, which had been pushed during a recent update without proper validation.
14:30 UTC:
The erroneous configuration was corrected, and the Nginx service was restarted successfully. Traffic began to flow normally to the backend servers.
14:45 UTC:
The outage was declared resolved after monitoring confirmed that the service was fully operational and user access was restored.

## Root Cause and Resolution


Root Cause:
The root cause of the outage was a syntax error in the Nginx configuration file. During a routine update, a configuration change was made to the load balancer to optimize traffic distribution. However, a small but critical syntax error in the file caused Nginx to fail to start, which in turn prevented it from forwarding traffic to the web servers. The error went unnoticed during the update process due to a lack of automated validation checks on the configuration files.
Resolution:
The DevOps team corrected the syntax error in the Nginx configuration file. Once the configuration was corrected, the Nginx service was restarted, and traffic flow was restored. The update process has since been amended to include an automated syntax validation step to prevent similar issues in the future.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures


Improvements and Fixes:
Implement automated syntax validation for Nginx configuration files before they are applied to production.
Enhance the monitoring system to detect configuration issues specifically related to load balancer health.
Provide additional training to the engineering team on the importance of configuration validation and proper testing procedures before pushing updates.
TODO List:
Add a syntax validation script to the CI/CD pipeline for Nginx configuration files.
Set up a monitoring alert specifically for load balancer health checks to catch issues before they impact traffic.
Conduct a post-incident review session with the engineering and DevOps teams to discuss the issue and reinforce best practices.
Review and update documentation on the Nginx configuration update process, including the new validation steps.

This postmortem serves as a record of the incident, outlining the steps taken to resolve the issue and the measures implemented to prevent recurrence. By learning from this outage, we aim to improve the reliability of our systems and provide a more robust service to our users.
